    <h1>Word Wide Web General</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) became a transformative success due to several key technologies and standards that provided a foundation for the internet as we know it today. Here are the most essential technologies:

1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
Description: HTML is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web, allowing text, images, and other media to be linked via hyperlinks.
Impact: It enabled the creation of web pages that could be easily linked and navigated, which was fundamental for the web's usability and growth.
2. Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
Description: A URL is the unique address used to identify resources on the web.
Impact: It made locating resources like web pages, files, and images easy, helping users and machines to request and access web content.
3. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Description: HTTP is the protocol that defines how data is transmitted between web browsers and servers.
Impact: This stateless, lightweight protocol facilitated the efficient transfer of information across the web, contributing to its scalability.
4. Web Browsers
Description: Web browsers, such as early versions like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, allowed users to access and interact with web content.
Impact: These user-friendly applications played a crucial role in popularizing the web by making it easy for non-technical users to browse and navigate websites.
5. Search Engines
Description: Early search engines like AltaVista and later Google provided the ability to find information across the vast web quickly.
Impact: They revolutionized the user experience by organizing the growing content and making it accessible in a more structured way, thus driving more people to use the web.
6. Domain Name System (DNS)
Description: DNS is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses.
Impact: DNS made the web accessible to the average user, sparing them from having to remember complex IP addresses to access websites.
7. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Description: CSS allows for the separation of content and design on web pages.
Impact: CSS helped web pages become more visually appealing and maintainable, improving the web's overall user experience.
8. JavaScript
Description: JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic interaction on web pages.
Impact: JavaScript transformed static web pages into interactive experiences, enabling features like form validation, dynamic content updates, and richer user interfaces.
9. Web Servers (e.g., Apache)
Description: Web servers host websites and handle requests from browsers using HTTP.
Impact: The development of robust, scalable web servers like Apache ensured that websites could handle increasing traffic efficiently.
10. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
Description: TCP/IP is the foundational communication protocol of the internet that ensures reliable data transmission.
Impact: It allowed computers to communicate and exchange information across networks, forming the backbone of the internet and the web.
These technologies created the architecture that made the World Wide Web easy to use, scalable, and powerful, turning it into a global phenomenon.</p>

    Resources on the web, such as HTML pages, images, videos, and other files, are addressed using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). URLs are structured addresses that specify where a resource is located on the web
