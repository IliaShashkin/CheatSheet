  <h1>What is a Web Server?</h1>
    <p>A web server is a computer system that hosts websites and serves web content to users over the internet or an intranet. It handles requests from clients (usually web browsers) using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol and responds by delivering the requested web pages or resources.</p>

    <h2>What Does a Web Server Do?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handles Requests:</strong> Receives requests for pages when a user types a URL into a browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Processes Requests:</strong> Processes the request, which may involve fetching files, running scripts, or querying databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Sends Responses:</strong> Sends the requested data back to the client, which could be HTML files, images, CSS, JavaScript, or other resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Manages Security:</strong> Handles security features like SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Logs Activity:</strong> Logs each request, useful for monitoring and analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Can Content Be Stored on a Web Server?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File System:</strong> Web content is stored in directories on the server’s file system, where HTML files, images, CSS, and other assets are saved.</li>
        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Dynamic content like user information or blog posts is stored in databases, with the server querying the database when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Management Systems (CMS):</strong> Systems like WordPress manage content on a web server, using databases to serve dynamic content based on templates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How is Content in Webpages Described?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> Defines the structure of the webpage.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> Styles HTML elements, defining layout, colors, fonts, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages.</li>
        <li><strong>Server-Side Languages:</strong> Languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js generate dynamic content on the server side.</li>
        <li><strong>APIs and Data Formats:</strong> Content can be described using formats like JSON or XML, used with APIs to serve data to client-side applications.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>World Wide Web General</h1>

    <h2>What are the Most Essential Technologies that Made the World Wide Web a Success?</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web became a success due to a combination of several essential technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> The foundational language for creating and structuring web pages, allowing text, images, links, and other elements to be displayed in browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> The protocol used for transferring data over the web, enabling communication between web servers and browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Software applications like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that allow users to access and interact with web content.</li>
        <li><strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</strong> A standardized way to address resources on the web, allowing users to find and access specific web pages and files.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> A styling language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages, separating content from design.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages, making them more engaging and responsive.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Servers that host websites and deliver web content to users, managing requests and providing responses to client browsers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Are Resources (HTML Pages, Images, etc.) Addressed on the Web?</h2>
    <p>Resources on the web are addressed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). A URL is a specific address that points to a resource, such as an HTML page, image, video, or file, on a web server. The URL uniquely identifies the location of the resource, allowing browsers to retrieve and display it.</p>

    <h2>What Are the General Components of a URL?</h2>
    <p>A URL typically consists of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Specifies the method of access, usually <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> (e.g., <code>https://</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> The address of the server hosting the resource, such as <code>www.example.com</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Port (Optional):</strong> A number specifying the port used by the server, often omitted because default ports (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) are assumed.</li>
        <li><strong>Path:</strong> The specific location of the resource on the server, such as <code>/folder/page.html</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Query Parameters (Optional):</strong> Additional data passed to the server, typically in the form of key-value pairs after a <code>?</code>, such as <code>?id=123</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragment (Optional):</strong> A reference to a specific section within a page, identified by a <code>#</code>, such as <code>#section2</code>.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Web Client</h1>

    <h2>What is a Web Client?</h2>
    <p>A web client is any software or device that accesses and interacts with web servers to retrieve or send information. The most common web client is a web browser, but other types of web clients include mobile apps, web-based email clients, and software that connects to web APIs.</p>

    <h2>What Does a Web Client Do?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sends Requests:</strong> The web client sends HTTP requests to web servers to fetch resources such as HTML pages, images, or data from a server.</li>
        <li><strong>Receives Responses:</strong> The client receives responses from the server, which usually include the requested resources, such as web pages, data, or error messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Renders Content:</strong> For browsers, the client renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages visually, allowing user interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Handles User Input:</strong> The client collects and sends user input back to the server, such as form submissions or clicks on links.</li>
        <li><strong>Manages Sessions:</strong> Maintains sessions through cookies or tokens, enabling personalized user experiences and state management across different requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is a Web Client and Web Browser the Same?</h2>
    <p>While a web browser is a type of web client, not all web clients are web browsers. Here’s the distinction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> A specific type of web client designed for general browsing of the web. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. Browsers are interactive, graphical interfaces that render web content visually.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Web Clients:</strong> Includes software like email clients, mobile apps, command-line tools (e.g., cURL), and automated scripts that interact with web servers without rendering visual content like a browser does.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, all web browsers are web clients, but not all web clients are web browsers.</p>

  <h1>Hello World and HTML Basics</h1>

    <h2>What is the HTML Head Element?</h2>
    <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and links to resources used by the HTML document. It does not directly display content on the webpage but provides essential information like the document’s title, character set, stylesheets, and scripts.</p>
    <p>Typical elements inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>: Sets the title of the webpage displayed on the browser tab.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>: Provides metadata such as character encoding (<code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li><code>&lt;link&gt;</code>: Links to external resources, like CSS files.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;style&gt;</code>: Contains internal CSS styles.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;script&gt;</code>: Links to or includes JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Does <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> Mean?</h2>
    <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is a declaration that defines the document type and version of HTML used. It tells the browser to render the page in standard mode, ensuring consistent interpretation of the code according to HTML5 specifications. It’s not an HTML tag but a necessary instruction placed at the very beginning of the document.</p>

    <h2>What Are the Two Topmost Elements Within the HTML Element?</h2>
    <p>The two topmost elements within the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code>: Contains metadata, links, and other resources necessary for the document.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>: Contains the actual content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other interactive elements displayed to the user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Emphasize Text and How Is It Displayed in the Browser?</h2>
    <p>To emphasize text, use the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element. Emphasized text is usually displayed in italics in the browser.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p><code>&lt;em&gt;This text is emphasized.&lt;/em&gt;</code> will display as: <em>This text is emphasized.</em></p>

    <h2>How to Mark Up Important Text and How Is It Displayed in the Browser?</h2>
    <p>To mark up important text, use the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element. Important text is usually displayed in bold in the browser.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p><code>&lt;strong&gt;This text is important.&lt;/strong&gt;</code> will display as: <strong>This text is important.</strong></p>
 
</body>
